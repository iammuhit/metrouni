                The waves of globalisation of knowledge, its expansion and dissemination have brought a radical shift in the concept of university. A further shift is registered in dismantling the age-old notion that the state alone is to shoulder the burden of tertiary education and accommodating the private universities to share this national duty, of course, without making any compromise in academic excellence and other matrices of university education. Metropolitan University joins this historic shift to bring quality university education at affordable cost to the doorsteps of the students.
                With the approval of the Ministry of Education under the Private University Act of 1992 (which was amended in 1998) the Metropolitan University came into being on 3rd May 2003.
                Dr. Toufique Rahman Chowdhury, a promising educationist and an entrepreneur of the country initiated the idea of founding Metropolitan University with the direct participation and assistance of a few of his close friends, acquaintances and associates with the main objective of promoting modern education, particularly, higher and advance education in the various spheres of learning in order to help build up mainly an educated nation of our own fully realising that such an enterprise might add only a mite to the vast field of higher education.
                This is a social commitment of Metropolitan University mainly to our nation for promoting better education to meet the changing needs of the globe in the 21st century.
                The University will serve the citizens of the country and of other countries through its instructions, research and outreach programmes and prepare them to meet the challenges of the global economy successfully.
                In the delivery of educational programmes on campus and beyond, the university will draw heavily upon the new instructional and outreach technologies available in the emerging information age.
